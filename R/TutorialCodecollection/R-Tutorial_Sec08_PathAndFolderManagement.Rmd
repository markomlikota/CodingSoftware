# A path is the location on your computer (think of a folder) 
# which R uses to look for datasets you call and to store things you tell it to store. 
# Here's how we can define and change the path 
# (note that, in order to run this code, you need to insert paths that work for your own computer):


# Have a look at the folder (path) that R is currently in:

getwd() # "get working directory"


# Change the path: 

setwd("/Users/markomlikota/Documents/MySpecialFolder")

# If you regularly go between different paths/folders, it makes sense to define them first:
sMyPath = "/Users/markomlikota/Documents/MySpecialFolder" 
setwd(sMyPath)
 

# Change the path to a sub-folder inside "MySpecialFolder":

setwd( paste(sMyPath,"/MySubFolder",sep="") )

# again, it might make sense to store this path:
sMySubPath = paste(sMyPath,"/MySubFolder",sep="")
setwd(sMySubPath)



# Paths are computer-specific. 
# However, if you collaborate with others via Dropbox, 
# you can define the path relative to the Dropbox folder, 
# so that everyone can use the same path definition and hence run the same code:
setwd('~/Dropbox/OurSpecialFolder') 
# (This works provided that everyone has "OurSpecialFolder" in the same location inside their Dropbox.)


```

```{r, eval=FALSE}

# We can also use R to create and delete folders in our path (i.e. on our computer):

# List all folders in the current path:
dir() 

# Create a folder "abc" in the current path:
dir.create("abc") 

# Verify whether folder "abc" exists in current path:
dir.exists("abc")

# Delete folder "abc" in current path: (need computer's permission for that)
unlink("abc")


```
